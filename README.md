# Minerar Chunk Turtle Computer Craft

This is a simple program I did to automate ore mining in survival Minecraft multiplayer. Feel free to use it, change it, and publish it.

[Link to pastebin repository](https://pastebin.com/u/M4ND4RiM) where you can simply give the turtle the command: 

`pastebin get (PASTEBIN LINK TO THE CODE) (NAME TO THE TURTLE PROGRAM)`

I recommend the last version I did ["minerarChunk v3"](https://pastebin.com/N3VG3Tdw), but to use it, you will need ender chests or some kind of portable storage. 3 ender chests for the turtle (torches, coal, and deposit) and 3 chests for remote input (torches, coal, and deposit).

For the begging, use the ["minerarChunk v2"](https://pastebin.com/NVtHyBPS), but bare in mind that this one contains some bugs that make the turtle navigate with error. But it doesn't use any kind of special chests.
